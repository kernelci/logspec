# The following [flake8] configuration is used to enforce code style while allowing some flexibility:
# - E203: Whitespace before ':' is ignored to comply with PEP 8 when using slicing.
# - E266: Allow multiple leading '#' characters for block comments.
# - E501: Line length is managed by `max-line-length` instead of enforcing 79 characters.
# - W503: Line break before binary operator is allowed as it is preferred in PEP 8.
